# Topic Test
- This folder stores data to test whether prompt topic has an influence on LLM's performance. All prompt constraints will be put at the very front and all tags using "gte" and target will be set to be 800 so that all performance decline will be due to topic choice instead of word target (at the start)
- consider changing to other word target (increase) and eventually other relation tags
